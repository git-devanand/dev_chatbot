Although the legal and financial reasons remain unclear, the rivalry between Celera and the NIH ended when they joined forces, thus speeding completion of the rough draft sequence of the human genome. The completion of the rough draft was announced in June 2000 by Collins and Venter. For the next three years, the rough draft sequence was refined, extended, and further analyzed, and in April 2003, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the publication that described the double-helical structure of DNA, written by British biophysicist Francis Crick and American geneticist and biophysicist James D.

Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources. Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones taken from many different libraries were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by Dr. Pieter J. de Jong.

This first work meant that a few months before publishing the sequence of the human genome, Celera contacted them again to visualize the sequence of the human genome. “When we were developing the software, here in Barcelona, I thought I was working on something that was important, but just as many scientists consider that their research is important.
